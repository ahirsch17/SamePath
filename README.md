📍 SamePath

An original concept and personal project by Alexis Hirsch

SamePath is a mobile app designed for college students to naturally connect with others who share similar daily paths across campus. Whether you’re walking to class, grabbing food, or heading to the gym, SamePath makes it easy to find overlap with classmates — without sacrificing privacy.

💡 Purpose

SamePath solves a real student problem: it’s hard to meet people when everyone’s moving in different directions. The app lets users:
	•	Enter their class schedules and availability
	•	Match with others who share walking routes or downtime
	•	Discover familiar faces on similar paths
	•	Stay in control with opt-in sharing and privacy settings

It’s not about constant location tracking — it’s about showing you who’s on a similar schedule.
