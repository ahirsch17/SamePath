📍 SamePath

An original concept and personal project by Alexis Hirsch

SamePath is a mobile app designed for college students to naturally connect with others who share similar daily paths across campus. Whether you’re walking to class, grabbing food, or heading to the gym, SamePath makes it easy to find overlap with classmates — without sacrificing privacy.


💡 Purpose

SamePath solves a real student problem: it’s hard to meet people when everyone’s moving in different directions. The app lets users:
	•	Enter their class schedules and availability
	•	Match with others who share walking routes or downtime
	•	Discover familiar faces on similar paths
	•	Stay in control with opt-in sharing and privacy settings

It’s not about constant location tracking — it’s about showing you who’s on a similar schedule.


📱 Key Features
	•	🗓 Schedule Setup – Users input their classes and availability
	•	🧭 Path Matching – Finds overlap in time + location with others
	•	🔒 Privacy First – You choose what to share and when
	•	🫂 Contact Syncing (Optional) – Helps surface familiar names first
	•	📱 Clean Mobile UI – Minimal, friendly, and built for students
	•	✅ Onboarding Flow – Easy startup with verification and privacy control


🚧 Development Status

SamePath is in active development and currently being tested using Expo Go.


📦 Future Plans
	•	🔔 Push notifications for nearby matches or overlaps
	•	🌙 Dark mode
	•	🛡️ Safety check-in feature
	•	🗺️ Campus map integration
	•	👻 Snapchat or social integration for profile photos
	•	📤 App Store release (after migrating to bare workflow)


🧪 Testing

Tested with Expo Go across multiple devices. Schedule logic, onboarding UX, and early contact matching have been validated using mock student data.
